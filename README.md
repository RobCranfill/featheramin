# featheramin
A Feather-based theramin!

This project may or may not become a useful thing. I'm just having fun playing around with the Feather and its various add-ons!

Hardware required so far:
 * Adafruit Feather RP2040 microcontroller
 * Adafruit VL53L0X time-of-flight proximity sensor
 * Adafruit APDS-9960 proximity/gesture sensor
 * Adafruit 1 watt audio amplifier and speaker
 
and a breadboard and a few wires to put them together!

So far this code is written in CircuitPython, but I may eventually want/need to port it to C. We shall see, ha ha.
